This is the open-source code for the paper "MRFNet: Multi-Scale Reparameterized Fusion Network for Efficient Small Object Detection in Aerial Imagery." The paper is currently under review. The abstract is as follows: 
Small objects in aerial imagery often exhibit low resolution, weak signals, and limited semantic cues, while repeated downsampling in existing detectors further degrades critical spatial details. To balance detection accuracy and computational efficiency, we propose MRFNet, a Multi-Scale Reparameterized Fusion Network built upon the YOLOv11 architecture. Specifically, we introduce a Triple-path Reparameterization Channel (TRC) module that utilizes multi-scale receptive fields during training to enhance the semantic representation of small objects. To address detail loss in feature fusion, a Multi-Scale Product Fusion (MSPF) module is designed for the top-down path, while an Adaptive Weighted Fusion (AMF) module is incorporated into the bottom-up path to emphasize informative features. The detection head replaces the conventional low resolution P5 layer with a high-resolution P2 layer, and the windmill convolution is adopted to better capture directional structures of small objects. Experiments on VisDrone2019, DIOR, and RSOD datasets achieve 47.7%, 79.0%, and 94.6% mAP50, surpassing YOLOv11n by 50.0%, 2.9%, and 0.3%, respectively. With fewer parameters and reduced computational cost, MRFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and is successfully deployed on mobile edge devices.
